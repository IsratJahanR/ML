## Getting Started

Each project is designed to be independent with its own setup instructions. Below are the general steps to get started:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (or others as needed for each project).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IsratJahanR/ML.git
cd ML
